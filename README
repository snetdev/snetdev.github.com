WWW repos for snetdev
------------------------

This repository contains the content + markup for the S-Net
repository website on Github. The content is written in Markdown.

In order to view this repository on a locally running webserver
you need to install Jekyll. Jekyll will convert the Markdown files
to HTML. Jekyll can be installed either from http://jekyllrb.com/
or from the usual Linux software package installation resources.
The latter option requires the packages "ruby" and "ruby-devel"
to be installed first.  Then continue with "gem install jekyll".

When Jekyll is installed it can be run in the toplevel 
directory of this repository with "jekyll1.9 --server --auto".
This will give you a webserver for this repository
on some TCP port number which is printed on stdout.
